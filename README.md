The main functionality that was applied in this project:
- JSON parsing
- URLSession
- JSONDecoder
- UserDefault
- DispatchQueue
- UIALertController
- UITextView

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).\
Simultaneously with the refactoring, the API source was changed because the old one was no longer supported.

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
