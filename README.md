This project was the eighth app writen by myself. It helped me to understand an UIALertController, UITextView, UserDefaults, URLSession, JSONDecoder and DispatchQueue methods a little further. I also learned how to parse JSON data, received from the Internet. 

At some moment - the project was refactored to exclude a storyboard UI design. All UI is writen by code since then, but i saved my first project realisation into a separate branch, called ui_by_storyboard(before_refactoring).
Simultaneously with the refactoring, the API source was changed because the old one was no longer supported.

Disclaimer:
The project was made for educational purposes only.
